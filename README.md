<h1>Home Page</h1>

<p>The first page of my Updated Portfolio Page is the <a href ="https://guled06.github.io/Updated-Portfolio-Page/">Home page</a>. In this page, a recent picture of me is displayed with a a few paragraphs about myself and my journey to becoming a software developer. Previously, I created a portfolio application similar to this one, where I displayed a picture of myself and I shared a few paragraphs about myself. The reader of this readme file can visit my previous portfolio application and the user can see the stark difference in the older portfolio and the updated portfolio page. The amount of improvement I have made in the short period of time between the two applications is truly remarkable. The older portfolio application can be visited by clicking <a href="https://guled06.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/">MY OLD PORTFOLIO PAGE</a>.

The first button redirects the user to my LinkedIn page, the second button redirects the user to a page containing a screenshot of my resume and a downloadable link of my resume in pdf. If the third button is clicked, it will redirect the user to my Github repository page.
