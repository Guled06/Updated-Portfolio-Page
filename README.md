This is my updated portfolio. This portfolio was designed to give the reader an overview of who I am. In this portfolio I will be showcasing some of the projects I have worked on and the links to the GitHub repositories and deployed links of these projects will also be provided. I have included a link to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles and my email.
